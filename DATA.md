## Instance Preparation

The structure of datasets are organized under `datasets` as follows
```plaintext
./data/$DATASET_NAME
├── train
    └── instances  # training instances

```
where each dataset is placed in their own `$DATASET_NAME` directory

The instances (.mps or .lp files) of each dataset should be prepared and placed in `./data/$DATASET_NAME/train/instances`, respectively.

- For BIP dataset, instances can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ds4dm/ml4co-competition/blob/main/DATA.md). One can use instances 0-299 for training.

- For BPP dataset, instances are generated by running
    ```plaintext
    python ins_generation.py
    ```

- For SMSP dataset, please convert instances from the [steelmillslab set](http://becool.info.ucl.ac.be/steelmillslab) into `.mps` format by running
    
    ```plaintext
    python gen_smsp.py
    ```


## Solution Collection

The (high-quality) solutions of training instances are collected and stored in `./data/$DATASET_NAME/train/solutions` using MILP solver SCIP by


```plaintext

# BIP
python collect_sols.py --rootDir ./data/BIP/train --nWorkers 5 --maxTime 3600
# BPP
python collect_sols.py --rootDir ./data/BPP/train --nWorkers 5 --maxTime 3600
# SMSP
python collect_sols.py --rootDir ./data/SMSP/train --nWorkers 5 --maxTime 3600

```

*Note: this step may take a couple of days.*
