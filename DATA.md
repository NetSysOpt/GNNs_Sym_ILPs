## Instance Preparation

The structure of datasets are organized under `./data` as follows
```plaintext
./data/$DATASET_NAME
├── train
    └── instances  # training instances

```
where each dataset is placed in their own `$DATASET_NAME` directory

The instances (.mps or .lp files) of each dataset should be prepared and placed in `./data/$DATASET_NAME/train/instances`, respectively.

- For BIP dataset, instances can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ds4dm/ml4co-competition/blob/main/DATA.md). One can use instances 0-299 for training.

- For BPP dataset, instances are generated by running
    ```plaintext
    python ins_generation.py
    ```
  *Note: A random seed setting is currently missing; one may add it to address this omission.*

- For SMSP dataset, please convert instances from the [steelmillslab set](http://becool.info.ucl.ac.be/steelmillslab) into `.mps` format by running
    
    ```plaintext
    python gen_smsp.py
    ```


## Solution Collection

The (high-quality) solutions of training instances are collected and stored in `./data/$DATASET_NAME/train/solutions` using MILP solver SCIP by


```bash


# BPP
python collect_sols.py --rootDir ./data/BPP/train --nWorkers 5 --maxTime 3600


# BIP
python collect_sols.py --rootDir ./data/BIP/train --nWorkers 5 --maxTime 3600


# SMSP
python collect_sols.py --rootDir ./data/SMSP/train --nWorkers 5 --maxTime 3600

```

*Note: The solution files for the BIP and SMSP datasets are already available in their respective directories. Running this step from scratch can take multiple days.*
